# Mortgage-Calculator
## Program Description
- The purpose of this program is to utilize Python tkinter to write a GUI based mortgage calculation program. There is exception handling so that the user does not enter invalid inputs. The user will enter a loan amount, interest rate, and loan term in years, and these values will calculate the monthly payment of the mortgage, and the total paid. The user will not be able to change the fields of monthly payment and total paid. There is a calculate button to calculate based on user input in the fields, a chart button which will print out a 30 year historical mortgage data line chart, and a quit button to exit the program.
- This program was created in the course of CNET-142 taught by Ron Sha in the Spring of 2021
